                                        A common mistake that home fruit growers make is harvesting the crop too soon, especially for grapes and apples.
                                        The color changes observed on the fruit do not necessarily align with full maturity.
                                         <br>
                                         It's easier to tell when berry crops are ready to pick through visual cues, such as changes to color, or the ease that the fruit comes off the plant (raspberry in particular). 
                                         Those small fruits have a short and fast ripening period between bloom and harvest.

                                         If you are trying to improve your diet, cruciferous vegetables are a good place to start. 
                                         The cabbage may help protect against radiation, prevent cancer, and reduce heart disease risk.
