                                            For decades, frozen foods found on the cold shelves of grocery stores have been the quick, affordable, and,
                                             more often than not, tasty options to pop in the microwave or oven, taking the place of cooking a meal from scratch on busy, or lazy days.
                                             Because the frozen dinner is already being prepared, 
                                            it's sometimes not aware to consumers what exactly they're eating, and in certain cases, 
                                            just how bad it can be for them, as many frozen foods are jam-packed with saturated fats, sodium, and sugars that can lead to unwanted weight gain or other health risks.

                                        Unlike other steak meals, a Salisbury steak is an American dish, made from a combination of ground beef and other ingredients. 
                                        Therefore, it might not be too surprising for consumers to see that the first ingredient listed for Banquet's version of the meal is mechanically separated chicken.

                                         You're going to see a lot of chemicals and additives where you think, 'Huh, 
                                         if I was going to make [this] in my kitchen I wouldn't use any of those things, and I don't even know what many of those things are," says Nicole Buerkens, PhD, CNS.

                                       Kellogg's Eggo waffles are a staple for many breakfasts,
                                        especially before school for kids. While they feature prominently on the packaging, strawberries are the 12th ingredient listed for these breakfast items.

                                        The combination of Buffalo chicken and macaroni and cheese is like a bar food lover's dream come true, and this meal is packed with protein with 29 grams,
                                         but Hauser says she's concerned about the level of sodium in just this one meal—1,780 milligrams.

                                        Totino's Pizza Rolls is a relatively cheap, kid and adult-friendly miniature serving of pizza, 
                                        and while they are tasty and price-conscious, they're also pretty unhealthy. 
                                        A serving of six pizza rolls contains 230 calories, and the serving size is far too few to fill someone up, resulting in a way higher calorie intake, 
                                        because Lisa Richards, a nutritionist and the author of The Candida Diet says "no one stops at just six."

                                        With a name like Lean Cuisine, it's easy to imagine that this would be a great purchase for your waistline and health, and while Lean Cuisine products are overall low on calories, 
                                        they still aren't the best items to take off the shelf and put into your freezer—especially not the Glazed Chicken
                                        <br><br>
                                        The chicken is coated with high fructose corn syrup, several preservatives, salt, and artificial caramel color," says Dan DeFigio, a certified sports nutritionist and the author of Beating Sugar Addiction for Dummies.
                                         "The rice accompanying the chicken is blanched, enriched rice, meaning that all the nutrients have been stripped away, leaving just the carbohydrate shell.
                                        It also contains partially hydrogenated oil (trans fats), sugar, maltodextrin (more sugar), and caramel coloring."
